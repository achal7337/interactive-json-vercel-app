I've been doing some birdwatching in the nearby nature reserves and I thought you might be interested in some of the species I've spotted.\n\nI've seen a few pairs of Montagu's Harriers, which are quite rare in these parts. I've also spotted some beautiful White-tailed Eagles, which are a thrill to see up close. I've attached a few photos I took with my binoculars.\n\nI know you're busy with your research, but I thought you might appreciate a break from the world of quantum mechanics.
