I need you to calculate the preference ratio of action games sold to sports games sold specifically for the year 2020 so I can send that data to the customer. Make sure to analyze the data accordingly, considering these discrepancies. I spoke to the technical team about it and they said that the person responsible had another issue assigned that was given priority by Javier on their channel. Can you give me the email of that person as well as the email of the person who prioritized the other issue so I can reach out to them directly?",

    "PROMPT": "I have been in talks with Jordan K about the optimization algorithm that we want to use to predict inventory demand. Initially, the idea is to use ML algorithms to analyze historical sales data and other factors. For the algorithm improvement and fine-tuning section, I have spoken with an experienced developer in ML and optimization algorithms, and I would like them to work together. We have compiled a list of properties in the UK, and the plan is for them to stay in the country known as the land of song, based on these properties, help me find a property in that country with at least two bedrooms and a maximum budget of \u00a31400? If you find several properties, give me the name of the one located in the area with the lowest rate of violent crime, as I am concerned about their safety. Also, please give me Jordan's email address so I can let him know about the plans.",

I'm always looking for movies to recommend and watch with my friends, so can you give me the name of that movie if I haven't already watched it? Otherwise, please give me the name of the movie in the same genre that I haven't watched, the one with the highest metascore. I also want to ask Rohan whether he's seen the movie, I asked him for a movie recommendation the other day during a conversation about quantum computing in sports, so please give me his email. Also, please give me Kaida's email, I loved the movie she recommended, The Quantum Prophecy, and I want to return the favor. ",
